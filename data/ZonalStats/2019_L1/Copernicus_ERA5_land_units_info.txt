2m Temperature                   Kelvin                       Subtract 273.15 to convert values to Centigrade. THIS HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE ZONAL STATS IN THIS FOLDER.

Total Evaporation                m of water                   Negative values indicate water evaporated, positive values indicate condensation.

Precipitation                    m-depth                      Total of all precipitation.

Leaf Area Index h                m2 m-2                       One half total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for high vegetation.

Leaf Area Index l                m2 m-2                       One half total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for low vegetation.

10m Wind u                       m s-1                        Eastward windspeed at 10m height. Can be combined with Northward windspeed to find speed and direction of 10m horizontal wind.
