Stats created using data the global rasters downloaded on 06/01/2021 from Copernicus prodcut: ERA5 - Land monthly averaged data from 1981 to present. (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=overview)
The following countries utilised the global rasters:
AGO
BWA
CMR
EGY
GAB
KEN
LYB
MOZ
NAM
NGA
RWA
TZA
UGA
ZAF
ZMB
ZWE

A set of subset rasters for the same months were also used. Downloaded 16/03/2021 from Copernicus product: ERA5 - Land monthly averaged data from 1981 to present. (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=overview)
The following countries had zonal statistics performed on subset rasters:
BFA
BEN
CIV
GHA
MAR
SEN
TGO

The above subset coordinate boundaries are as follows:       44
                                            
                                                       27          60
 
                                                             39

The subset was used on the 2019 covariates to fix an issue experienced by a few countries when trying to use the original global rasters. It should be noted that
whilst these subset rasters represent the same covariates for the same months and year, they exhibit in some cases, marginally different pixel values to the 
global version. This difference is minor and believed to begin at the ~2 or 3 decimal place. Moreover, the cell size of the subset is very slightly different to 
the global version. It is not known why such differences exist but useful to be aware of.




****ALL COUNTRY 2020 ZONAL STATISTICS HAVE BEEN RUN USING A SUBSET MATCHING THE ABOVE COORDINATE BOUNDARIES - THE GLOBAL RASTER WAS NOT USED IN ANY CASE FOR 2020 TO AVOID
    THE ISSUES EXPERIENCED IN THE ABOVE 2019 DATA. 2020 DATA WAS DOWNLOADED ON 20/04/2021, WITH ADDITIONAL COVARIATES SURFACE PRESSURE, SKIN RESEVOIR CONTENT AND
    TOTAL RUNOFF DOWNLOADED LATER ON 07/05/2021. ALL PRODUCTS DOWNLOADED FROM: Copernicus product: ERA5 - Land monthly averaged data from 1981 to present. (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=overview).
