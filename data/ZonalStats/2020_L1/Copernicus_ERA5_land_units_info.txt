**These covariates come from the MONTHLY AVERAGED REANALYSIS dataset and have a native resolution of aprroximately 9km at the equator.

**Covariate measurents are monthly averages from daily data, thus, represent a daily average per month.

**Covariates which are accumulations - such as precipitation & evaporation had measurements taken at the 24th hour of each day within a month (e.g. how much rain fell in 24 hrs), then an average across all days in said month creates a daily average per month.

**Covariates 'Total Precipitation' and 'Total Runoff' represents depth in metres. This is the depth of the water if it were spread evenly across the grid cell.




COVARIATES USED FOR 2019 ZONAL STATISTICS:

Covariate:                       Native Measurment Unit:      Additional info:

 
2m Temperature                   Kelvin                       Temperature at 2m above land surface. Subtract 273.15 to convert values to Centigrade. THIS HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE ZONAL STATS IN THIS FOLDER.

Total Evaporation                m of water/day               Negative values indicate water evaporated, positive values indicate condensation.

Precipitation                    m-depth/day                  Total of all precipitation.

Leaf Area Index h                m2 m-2                       One half total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for high vegetation.

Leaf Area Index l                m2 m-2                       One half total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for low vegetation.

10m Wind u                       m s-1                        Eastward windspeed at 10m height. Can be combined with Northward windspeed to find speed and direction of 10m horizontal wind.

10m Wind v                       m s-1                        Northward windspeed at 10m height. Can be combined with Eastward windspeed to find speed and direction of 10m horizontal wind.



COVARIATES USED for 2020 ZONAL STATISTICS:

2m Temperature                   Kelvin                          Temperature at 2m above land surface. Subtract 273.15 to convert values to Centigrade. THIS HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE ZONAL STATS IN THIS FOLDER.

Total Evaporation                m of water                      Accumulated water which has evaporated from the Earth's surface. Negative values indicate water evaporated, positive values indicate condensation.

Precipitation                    m-depth (avg. over pixel)       Total of all precipitation.

Leaf Area Index h                m2 m-2                          One half total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for high vegetation.

Leaf Area Index l                m2 m-2                          One half total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for low vegetation.

10m Wind u                       m s-1 (metres/second)           Eastward windspeed at 10m height. Can be combined with Northward windspeed to find speed and direction of 10m horizontal wind.

10m Wind v                       m s-1 (metres/second)           Northward windspeed at 10m height. Can be combined with Eastward windspeed to find speed and direction of 10m horizontal wind.

Total Runoff                     m-depth (avg. over pixel)       Combination of both surface and subsurface runoff.

Surface Pressure                 Pa (Pascals)                    Force per unit area of the air on surface of land, sea and inland water. Can be combined with temperature to discover air density.

Skin Resevoir Content            m of water                      Amount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. Represents amount of rain intercepted by foliage and water from dew. Water leaves skin resevoir by evaporation.
